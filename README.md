# Energy-Consumption-Analysis

Project Title: Energy Consumption Analysis

Technologies: Data Cleansing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualization
(Tableau/Power BI)

Domain: Energy and Sustainability

Problem Statement:
Project will analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario's Broader
Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data. We
